(Q)Differences Between Document and Window Objects in javascript ?


     Introduction :

        
     When Working With javascript, it is crucial to understand the document and windows objects .
     As they play fundamental roles in manipulating and interacting with web pages .
     These objects are part of the document object model (DON) and are essential for web development .
     In this blog post, we'll delve into the differences between the Document and Window objects.
     Exploring their unique properties, methods, and use cases.


     THE DOCUMENT OBJECT

     The Document object represents the web page itself providing access to its structure and content.
     It serves as an interface to the HTML document and allows JavaScript to interact with the elements on the page.

     Here are some key characteristics of the Document object:

     1.Hierarchical Structure: The Document object represents the entire HTML document, which is structured hierarchically,
     comprising elements such as headings paragraphs forms, images, and more.

     2.Methods for Element Manipulation: The Document object offers methods like getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(),
     and getElementsByTagName() to locate and manipulate HTML elements within the document.
     
     3.Access to Document Properties: It allows access to document-specific properties like title, URL, and charset.
   
     4.DOM Manipulation: Developers often use the Document object to add, modify, or
     delete elements within the document dynamically changing the content and structure of a web page.

     

     THE WINDOW OBJECT

     The Window object represents the browser window or tab in which the web page is loaded.
     It provides access to various aspects of the browser including navigation, timing and interaction.

     key characteristics of the Window object:

     1.Global Scope: The Window object is a top-level object and has a global scope.
     Variables declared without the var, let, or const keywords are automatically attached to the Window object.

     2.Navigation Control: It offers methods like window.open(), window.close(),and window.
     location to control the browser's behavior, such as opening new windows or navigating to different URLs.

     3.Timing and Events: The Window object manages timers using setTimeout() and 
     setInterval(), and it handles events like onload, onresize, and onbeforeunload.

     4.Access to Global Functions: Certain global JavaScript functions, such as parseInt()
     and encodeURIComponent(), are actually properties of the Window object.

    
     Key Differences:
     Now that we've covered the basics of both objects

     1.Scope: The Document object operates within the scope of the HTML document,
     while the Window object operates within the browser's window or tab.

     2.Purpose: The Document object is primarily used for accessing and manipulating the content and
     structure of the web page,
     whereas the Window object is used for controlling the browser's behavior and handling
     events related to the browser window.

     3.The Document object represents a hierarchical structure of HTML elements,
     while the Window object provides access to global browser properties and methods.

     4.Manipulation vs. Control: You use the Document object to modify the content
     and structure of the web page,
     while the Window object is used to control the browser's behavior, navigate, and manage events......
